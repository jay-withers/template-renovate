# CHECKS has no default here (unlike BRANCH) - it must stay unset/empty so
# that the recipe below passes an empty string through to protect-branch.sh,
# which supplies its own (newline-separated) default. A Make variable can't
# hold that default itself: GNU Make invokes a separate shell per recipe line,
# splitting on any raw newline in an expanded value - even one inside a quoted
# shell string - which would break the quoting in the recipe below.
